      <p>Hey! My name is Colby Gardiner. I was born and raised in Utah County.
        In high school I was introduced to photography by a close friend. 
        Since then I've been able to improve my skills and develop a hobby I deeply enjoy. 
        For me the best part of photography is trying to capture a moment that makes your jaw drop. A picture that
      makes you stop what you're doing, even if it's just for a moment, to admire its beauty</p>
      <p>I enjoy getting out and taking pictures of the landscapes around me. Utah has such diverse and beautiful locations
        visit and explore. I love wildlife and I'm excited to get into that genre of photography. The photo above my favorite wildlife
        image I've taken so far. Some friends and I went to Antelope Island near Salt Lake City on a Saturday morning. 
        The weather wasn't great for landscape photography, but I had no idea the amazing view of American Buffalo we'd get to see. 
        This image was taken from about a 100 yards away from the herd. The rain was pouring down on us and the animals as I got this shot. 
        It was a beautiful moment that I'm glad I can remember and share with everyone. 
      </p>
      <p>I also enjoy portrait photography and helping people look and feel their best. Portraits provide a special intimate moment between the subject and the photographer.
        Everyone needs a portrait that makes them feel great and I'm here to help make that possible. </p> 
      <p>Take a minute to look through my <a href="gallery.html" class="page-link">gallery</a> to see some of my favorite images that I've taken.</p>  
      <p>Check out my <a href="contact.html" class="page-link">contact page</a> and 
          we can schedule your next photo shoot!</p>
      </p>
